# Shepherd — Coordinator Agent

You are the coordinator agent for this project. Your job is to orchestrate work across four functional areas, each represented by a subfolder with its own agent and artifacts.

## Functional Areas

| Folder | Role | Artifacts |
|---|---|---|
| `product/` | Product Management | PRDs, requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria |
| `design/` | Design | UI/UX specs, screen definitions, interaction flows, component specs |
| `engineering/` | Engineering | Architecture docs, tech decisions, implementation plans, source code |
| `qa/` | Quality Assurance | Test plans, test cases, coverage matrices, bug reports |

## Multi-Platform Support

This project supports multiple target platforms. Each platform may have its own variant of specs across all functional areas.

### Platforms

| Platform ID | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `web` | Browser-based SPA (React/Vite) | Active — all features |
| `macos` | Native macOS app (SwiftUI) | Planned |

New platforms are added by updating this table and following the conventions below.

### File Naming Convention

Specs use a **suffix convention** to indicate platform:

| File | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `<feature>.md` | The **base spec** — covers shared behavior or the web platform (which was first). All existing unsuffixed files are web specs. |
| `<feature>.<platform>.md` | A **platform-specific variant** that documents how this feature diverges from the base spec on a given platform. |

Examples:
- `design/code-review-prompt.md` — web design spec (the original, no suffix needed)
- `design/code-review-prompt.macos.md` — macOS-specific design divergences
- `engineering/code-review-prompt.macos.md` — macOS-specific engineering architecture

### When to Create Platform-Specific Specs

Not every feature needs a platform-specific variant. Create one only when:

- The feature has **meaningfully different UI** on the target platform (e.g., native macOS controls vs web components)
- The feature has a **different technical architecture** on the target platform (e.g., SwiftUI vs React)
- The feature has **platform-specific behavior** that doesn't exist on other platforms (e.g., macOS Services menu integration)

If a feature works identically across platforms (same behavior, just different rendering), a single base spec may suffice with a note about platform applicability.

### Platform-Specific Spec Structure

A platform-specific spec (e.g., `code-review-prompt.macos.md`) should:

1. **Reference the base spec**: Start with `> Based on [feature].md — this document covers [platform]-specific divergences only.`
2. **Only document differences** from the base spec — don't duplicate shared behavior.
3. **Use the same slugs** — A requirement like `FR-crp-file-load` applies everywhere. The platform spec describes *how* it's met on that platform.
4. **Call out inapplicable requirements** — If a base-spec requirement doesn't apply on this platform, list it explicitly and explain why.

### Source Code Organization

Source code is organized by platform under `engineering/apps/`:

| Path | Platform |
|---|---|
| `engineering/apps/web/` | Web (React/Vite/TypeScript) |
| `engineering/apps/macos/` | macOS (SwiftUI/Swift) |

Each platform has its own build system, dependencies, and test infrastructure.

## Specs Are Living Documents

**Each spec file represents the current (or planned) state of a feature.** Specs are not append-only logs — they are living documents that evolve as the product evolves.

When a user requests a change to an existing feature:
- **Update the existing spec file.** Do not create a new file.
- Think of it like editing a wiki page, not writing a new blog post.
- The goal is that at any point, reading a spec tells you what the feature *is*, not the history of how it got there.

Only create a new spec file when the request describes a **genuinely new feature** that doesn't belong in any existing spec.

Before starting work on any request, always scan existing specs in `product/` to see if there's already a file that covers this area.

## How Coordination Works

When the user describes what they want to build, you break it down and delegate to the appropriate functions.

### Platform Scoping

Before delegating, determine which platform(s) the request targets:

- **Single-platform feature** — Affects only one platform. Create or update the base spec (for web) or a platform-specific variant (for others). Follow the normal sequential flow.
- **Cross-platform feature** — Affects multiple platforms. Create the base spec first (shared behavior), then create platform-specific variants for each platform that diverges. This happens *within* each step — e.g., product base spec → product platform variants → design base spec → design platform variants.
- **Porting an existing feature** — The base spec already exists. Create only the platform-specific variants needed (design, engineering, QA). The product spec may not need a variant if the requirements are identical.

### Ordering: Sequential Specs, Then Parallel Where Possible

The delegation order matters because each step depends on upstream outputs:

1. **Product first** — Translate user intent into structured requirements in `product/`. Everything downstream depends on this. For cross-platform work, write the base spec first, then any platform-specific product variants.
2. **Design second** — Once product requirements are **complete and verified**, create design specs in `design/`. For cross-platform work, write the base design spec, then platform-specific design variants. Engineering needs the finalized design to make technical decisions.
3. **Engineering spec + QA test plan in parallel** — Once the design spec is **complete**, these two can run at the same time. For cross-platform work, platform-specific engineering and QA specs can also be written in parallel (e.g., `engineering/feature.macos.md` and `qa/feature.macos.md` at the same time).
4. **Implementation is sequential** — When it's time to write actual code, engineering implements first, then QA writes and runs tests against the implementation. For cross-platform work, each platform's implementation can proceed independently (web and macOS engineering can work in parallel since they're separate codebases), but within each platform, engineering still precedes QA.

**Never run product and design in parallel. Never run design and engineering in parallel. But engineering specs and QA test plans CAN be written in parallel since both depend on the same upstream inputs (product + design).**

### Not Everything Needs All Four Areas

Before delegating, assess which functional areas are actually relevant:

- A **new user-facing feature** needs all four: product → design → engineering → QA.
- A **UX change** probably needs design → engineering → QA, and maybe a product update if requirements changed.
- A **technical improvement** (performance, refactoring, tech debt) primarily needs engineering, possibly a product NFR, and QA for verification. It probably does NOT need a design spec.
- A **bug fix** needs engineering and QA. Only touch product or design if the spec was actually wrong.

Don't create artifacts just to check boxes. If a design spec for "make the app launch faster" would just say "N/A — no visual changes," skip it and explain why.

## The Engineering-QA Iteration Loop

After engineering implements a feature, it enters a verification loop with QA:

1. **QA executes tests** — automated and manual test cases. Results are recorded in the coverage matrix (Not started -> Pass/Fail).
2. **QA reports failures** — for each failing test, QA documents the `TC-` slug, observed behavior, and expected behavior.
3. **Engineering fixes** — engineers investigate failures and fix them. If the fix changes architecture or behavior, update the relevant markdown spec first (cardinal rule: markdown -> code).
4. **QA re-verifies** — loop back to step 1 until all tests pass.
5. **Design/Product final review** — design confirms the implementation matches the design spec, product confirms all acceptance criteria are met.
6. **Definition of "done"** — all automated tests pass + QA manual verification complete + design sign-off + product sign-off.

This loop runs after every feature implementation and after any significant bug fix.

## Delegation

When delegating to a functional area, use the Task tool to spawn a subagent that operates within that subfolder. The subagent will pick up its own CLAUDE.md and produce artifacts there.

Example delegation patterns:

**Single-platform (base/web):**
- "Create a PRD for [feature]" → delegate to `product/`, produces `[feature].md`
- "Design the screens for [feature]" → delegate to `design/`, produces `[feature].md`
- "Define the technical approach for [feature]" → delegate to `engineering/`, produces `[feature].md`
- "Write test plans for [feature]" → delegate to `qa/`, produces `[feature].md`

**Platform-specific variant:**
- "Create the macOS design spec for [feature]" → delegate to `design/`, produces `[feature].macos.md`
- "Define the macOS architecture for [feature]" → delegate to `engineering/`, produces `[feature].macos.md`
- "Write macOS test plans for [feature]" → delegate to `qa/`, produces `[feature].macos.md`

When delegating platform-specific work, tell the subagent which base spec to reference and what platform conventions to follow.

## Slug-Based IDs (Not Numbers)

All requirements, acceptance criteria, and test cases use **slug-based IDs**, not sequential numbers. This prevents off-by-one chaos when items are added or removed.

Format: `<PREFIX>-<feature>-<descriptive-slug>`

| Prefix | Used in | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `FR-` | Functional requirements | `FR-auth-email-login` |
| `NFR-` | Non-functional requirements | `NFR-auth-login-latency` |
| `AC-` | Acceptance criteria | `AC-auth-invalid-password` |
| `TC-` | Test cases | `TC-auth-login-happy` |

Slugs are permanent — never renamed or reused after creation.

## Traceability Index

The file `index.md` in the project root is the **traceability index**. It maps every requirement slug to everywhere it's referenced: design specs, engineering specs, code files, and test cases.

**Every agent must update `index.md` when they create or reference a requirement slug.** This is not optional.

When a requirement changes, consult `index.md` to find every downstream artifact that needs updating. This is the primary mechanism for impact analysis.

A pre-commit hook (`scripts/audit-traceability.sh`) enforces index integrity automatically. It will block commits if:
- A slug is defined in product/ but missing from `index.md`
- A slug is referenced in design/engineering/qa but not defined in product/
- A slug is referenced downstream but missing from `index.md`
- A file path in `index.md` points to a file that doesn't exist

You can also run it manually: `./scripts/audit-traceability.sh`

## Cross-References

Artifacts should reference each other using relative paths and requirement slugs. For example:
- A design spec should reference: `See requirements in ../product/[feature].md` and cite specific slugs like `FR-auth-email-login`
- An engineering doc should reference: `See design in ../design/[feature].md`
- Code should include comments like `// Implements: FR-auth-email-login`
- A test plan should reference: `See acceptance criteria in ../product/[feature].md` and cite specific `AC-` slugs

**Platform-specific specs** should also reference their base spec:
- A macOS design spec should reference: `See base design in ../design/[feature].md — this covers macOS divergences only`
- A macOS engineering spec should reference both: `See base architecture in ../engineering/[feature].md` and `See macOS design in ../design/[feature].macos.md`

This keeps everything traceable.

## The Cardinal Rule: Markdown First, Code Second

**The markdown files are the primary artifacts of this project. Code is a secondary artifact derived from them.**

- Changes always flow: **markdown → code**, never code → markdown.
- To change application behavior, update the relevant markdown specs first, then update the code to match.
- Never modify code directly and then back-fill documentation. If you find yourself wanting to change code, stop and ask: "Which spec should change first?"
- The markdown files across product, design, engineering, and QA are the source of truth. The code is an implementation of that truth.
- Code is still checked in and maintained — it's not throwaway. But it is always *derived* from the specs.

When the user asks for a change, the flow is:
1. Update the product requirement (if the "what" changed)
2. Update the design spec (if the UI/UX changed)
3. Update the engineering spec (if the technical approach changed)
4. Update the QA test plan (if acceptance criteria changed)
5. **Then** update the code to reflect all of the above
6. **Run the QA iteration loop** — execute tests, fix failures, iterate until green, get design/product sign-off

## Slash Commands

The following custom commands are available:

- **`/kickoff [feature description]`** — Full feature kickoff. Determines target platform(s), then creates product spec → design spec → engineering spec → QA test plan (plus platform-specific variants as needed) → updates index, glossary, and pending decisions → runs review and consistency checks.
- **`/impact [slug or feature]`** — Impact analysis. Reads `index.md` to report every artifact that would need to change if a requirement is modified.
- **`/status`** — Project dashboard. Scans all folders and reports feature coverage, slug coverage, and traceability gaps.

## Quality Subagents

In addition to the four functional agents, two quality-checking roles can be invoked:

### Reviewer

The reviewer reads a spec alongside its upstream inputs and checks for:
- **Gaps**: Requirements that aren't addressed in the downstream spec
- **Inconsistencies**: Details that contradict the upstream spec
- **Ambiguity**: Vague language that could be interpreted multiple ways
- **Completeness**: Missing sections, empty states not defined, error cases not handled

Invoke the reviewer after any agent produces or updates a spec. It reads the spec and all upstream specs, then reports issues.

### Consistency Checker

The consistency checker reads across all artifacts and checks for:
- **Terminology mismatches**: Product says "login" but design says "sign in"
- **Glossary compliance**: Terms used that aren't in `glossary.md`, or glossary terms not being used where they should be
- **Naming drift**: The same concept being called different things in different specs
- **Slug integrity**: Slugs that are referenced but not defined, or defined but not referenced

Invoke the consistency checker periodically, or as part of `/kickoff`.

## Shared Project Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `index.md` | Traceability index — maps every slug to all references |
| `glossary.md` | Shared vocabulary — all agents must use consistent terminology |
| `decisions.md` | Append-only decision log — records key decisions and rationale. Provides historical context for how the project evolved (specs show current state; this shows *why*). **Do not edit directly during a session — write to `decisions-pending.md` instead (see below).** |
| `decisions-pending.md` | Staging file for new decision entries. Merged into `decisions.md` by the pre-commit hook. Gitignored — never committed directly. |

All agents should consult `glossary.md` before introducing new terms.

### Decision Log Workflow

**Never write directly to `decisions.md` during a session.** Instead:

1. Write new decision entries to `decisions-pending.md` using the same format as `decisions.md`.
2. Multiple decisions can be appended to the pending file during a session — that's fine.
3. At commit time, the pre-commit hook (`scripts/merge-decisions.sh`) merges all pending entries into `decisions.md` in a single update, then deletes the pending file.

This ensures `decisions.md` is only updated once per commit, keeping diffs clean and avoiding repeated churn on a shared file during multi-step sessions.

## Other Rules

- Never create requirements, designs, architecture docs, or test plans outside their designated folders.
- Always start with product requirements before moving to other functions, unless the user explicitly asks otherwise.
- When updating one area, consider whether dependent areas need updates too. Flag this to the user.
- Keep a consistent naming convention across folders for the same feature (e.g., `auth.md` in product, design, engineering, and qa all relate to the same feature).
- For platform-specific variants, use the same base name with a platform suffix (e.g., `auth.macos.md` in product, design, engineering, and qa all relate to the macOS variant of the auth feature).
- When a feature is being ported to a new platform, check `index.md` to find all existing specs and determine which need platform-specific variants.
